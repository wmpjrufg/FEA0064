# This is a log file for Ftool. It will register your actions
# during your use of the program. When you close Ftool, this
# log will be deleted and no data will be saved or sent
# anywhere. If Ftool should crash, however, the next time you
# open it you'll receive a popup requesting that you allow
# Ftool to send this file to our system to help us figure out
# what went wrong. You will obviously be allowed to opt out of
# sending this information. You are welcome to open this file
# while using Ftool and see what we collect.
